# Browser Block Demo
This project is a ready-to-deploy example of the [balena browser block](https://github.com/balena-labs-projects/browser).

The browser block provides a hardware accelerated web browser to present internal and external URLs on a connected display. The browser block is a docker image that runs a Chromium browser via X11, optimized for balenaOS.

## Deploy this project

Simply click the button below. If you don't already have a [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/) account you'll be asked to create one. (BalenaCloud is a remote device management platform na dthe first ten devices are free and full-featured. No credit card required!)

Follow the instructions for downloading the image and flashing to an SD card to use to boot your device.

## Usage

Make sure your device is connected to the internet and the SD card/flash media is inserted. Also make sure a monitor is connected to your device so you can view the web browser display. Power on your device and after the software has been downloaded you should see the welcome web page on your monitor.

Initially you'll see a custom page generated by the project's on-device web server. By default, the browser block displays the output of any web server it finds on the device's port 80. You can change the displayed URL by setting a variable on the balenaCloud dashboard:

- On the balenaCloud dashboard, make sure you are viewing your device summary page by clicking on a device
- Click on
